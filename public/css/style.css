/* Any other global styles that are not easily handled by adding classes directly in HTML.
   For a Tailwind CDN project, this file might be very small or even empty if all styling
   is done via utility classes in the HTML.
   For now, we'll keep it minimal. We can add more specific global styles if needed.

/* For example, if we want a default link color that is not Tailwind's default blue,
   but still want it to be theme-aware, we could do:
a {
  color: #yourBrandLightLinkColor;
}
body.dark a {
  color: #yourBrandDarkLinkColor;
}
   However, it's usually better to use Tailwind's text color utilities like text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 directly on the <a> tags.
